      <h1>Forbes.</h1>

      <p>I picked this site because I thought it might be a little bit more intricate with its coding. First of all, the layout of Forbes is set up pretty good. The site even adjusts to mobile changes when shrinking and expanding. I like the color layout for the site too. It has a great general theme that seems to flow really well. The layout seems to help out the navigation portion of the website. Each link is relevant to the other links around the site.
Forbes has many levels of HTML in its code. Right where they wrote the DOCTYPE, they have an event in the lang=en that expands and has a lot of drop-down menus that lead to more HTML. All of these dropdown menus have their own HTML inside them. This is the most HTML I’ve seen in any site that I’ve looked at. The body also has and event with more drop-down menus. Along with the events, each element has its own css style and each box has its own properties. This is one of the most intricate HTML code pages that I have seen.
