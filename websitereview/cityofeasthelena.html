      <h1>City of East Helena.</h1>

      <p>I do not like this website layout most of all. The background picture fades out about 1/4 of the way down the page. I feel like it should be extended a little more before it starts fading out. The links on the sidebar look a little blocky as do the center blocks. The colors are fine and fit the theme of the site. The site has a gradient in the center box but no where else on the page. The seal of the city of East Helena is in the top left corner and the background shape of the box can be seen. I feel like its transparency could have been adjusted to hide the square shape. It feels like they gave each part of the page to a different person and then merged them all together on one page.

The elements look like they are HTML5 elements but it does not say it anywhere on the site like most other sites. This site has a bunch of scripts at the bottom of its code. The code does look a little clunky to me. The css looks very different than other sites. There are even color dots at the end of the color indicators in the css file. There are also a lot of divâ€™s in the body of the HTML. I feel like this site could use a tune up or two.
