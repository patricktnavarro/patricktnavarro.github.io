      <h1>506 Sports.</h1>

      <p>I picked this site because it lets you know what games are going to be shown on TV in your geographical area. This is specific to the Major League Baseball (MLB), College Football and the National Football League (NFL). For the MLB it shows what games are going to be played all the way through the regular season. For the NFL you have two sort of menus to look at. You can see on a map what games are played for your area. The map also shows what games are shown on Fox and CBS. For example, this Sunday the map shows that the early game on CBS is going to be Kansas City at Tennessee. The site lists the major networks that the Thursday, Monday, and Sunday night games are on. I like this site because the layout is simple and not over stimulating. There are not a lot of ads on the site and when you click on different menus there are not any unwanted pop-up.

At first I thought the site was very simple in its HTML5. I found an expandable button that opened more of the sites code. This code is about 15-20 metas, that start with origin-trial and have about two to three lines of content that is a mix of numbers and letters. The overall code for the HTML is very simple. It is only about 30 lines from body to body.

I feel the simplicity helps with the sites navigation. I also like how the colors used to differentiate between what games are being played. The map might not be close within a few feet but you get a good idea of what is going to be on. I really like that there are no pup-up ads every time you click on a different part of the page or even one of the links on the page.
