      <h1>Summer Time in Montana.</h1>
      <p>Although Summer-time is one of my favorite times of the year I still like Winter more. This picture was taken on a trip to Flathead lake. My wife had some friends come to visit from California and we took them on a pontoon boat that we had rented for half of the day.</p>

      <p>Summer time was created by the government in order to sell more sun-screen. Sun-screen has micro-chips in it to controll us better.</p>
