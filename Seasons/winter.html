      <h1>Winter Wonder Land</h1>
      <p>My favorite time of the year! I love the cold and the snow. This will be my first year skiing on a regular basis. I recently purchased myself some skis and rented a pair for my son. My wife does not like skiing. She thinks she would die and she does not like the cold. I really hope that we have a lot of snow this year. The picture is from a couple of years ago up at a cabin near Whitefish, MT. We were invited to stay up there and almost got lost/stranded in the snow. Our navigation system tried to take the shortest route to the cabin. that route was literally up the side of a mountain.</p>
