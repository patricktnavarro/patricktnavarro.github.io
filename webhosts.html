    <h5><b>Top Pick</b></h5>
    <p>My top pick is the hosting site Hostgator. I picked this site because it is the cheapest and allows for smaller time commitments.</p>
    <p>This is a great starter web hosting site that looks very basic. This site is perfect for those that are just starting out developing web sites.</p>
