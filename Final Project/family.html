      <p>My wife (Desiree) and I have been married for 15 years now. We met at my brothers wedding, where we were both part of the wedding party. I have three older brothers, a younger half-sister and a younger half-brother. My Father passed away just after he turned 60. My son did not get to meet him but they share birthdays (July 1st).</p>
      <p>This is the page dedicated to my family. I have a six-year-old son (whos name is Braxton) he is in first grade at Prickly Pear Elementary. He loves to play with bugs, dig in the dirt, and conduct scientific experiments. Braxton has eight pet fish. We started with five and two died. After two died there were five babies that showed up.</p>
