      <h1>This is my review of the Maryland State Websites</h1>
      <p>The Maryland website seems to be sleek as is the Maine website. They website has some good connections with other sites, such as Linkedin, Facebook and other social media platforms. Maryland also has a link for searching around Maryland for things to do. The overall functionality of the site seems to be pretty good. They have bright menus and a lot of eye catching colors on the home page too.</p>
