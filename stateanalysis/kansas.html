      <h1>This is my review of the Kansas State Websites</h1>
      <p>This website is very bare. The home page looks like a knock-off version of Google. The art that is on the page is very modern and eye catching. This page seems to want you to just type in what you are looking for and it will get it for you. I could see this frustrating people, as they may not know that you have to type in specific key words.</p>
